<h1 class="title">Homework: SQLAlchemy Practice</h1>

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We've created a file <cite>model.py</cite> that, when run, creates a database
of Hackbright employees. The focus of today's homework is to get some
practice querying a database using SQLAlchemy to get information that
you want. If you need help, take a look at the SQLAlchemy I &amp; II lectures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>Before you get started querying, make sure to do the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make and run a virtual environment in your working directory.</li>
<li>Install the requirements via the <cite>requirements.txt</cite> file.</li>
<li>Run <tt class="docutils literal">createdb emp</tt> in your terminal. (If you get an error, make sure Postgres is running on your computer.)</li>
<li>Create and populate the database using <tt class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-i</span> model.py</tt>.</li>
<li>If you run <cite>model.py</cite> again, it will try to seed the database a second time. PostgreSQL doesn't like this and will throw an error. To avoid this, exit interactive mode, and before running <cite>model.py</cite> a second time, comment out line 210 (<tt class="docutils literal">example_data()</tt>).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="directions">
<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>Now that your database is established, here are the queries that we'd
like you to run:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First, while running <tt class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-i</span> model.py</tt>, try using the included functions (<tt class="docutils literal">all_employees_nav()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">all_employees_join()</tt>) to get a list of all employees.</li>
<li>Next, run <cite>server.py</cite>, navigate to <cite>http://localhost:5000</cite>, and check out these functions as routes -- use the Debug Toolbar on the right to note the difference between running times and query numbers for the two functions. Why are they different? What does that mean?</li>
<li>Run <tt class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-i</span> model.py</tt> again, and grab the employee object with the name 'Cynthia Dueltgen.' (Hint: later steps will be easier if you bind the result of this query to a variable name.)</li>
<li>What department is she in? (Show the object for her department.)</li>
<li>What is the phone number of the department that Cynthia is in?</li>
<li>Find all employees whose department we don't know. (Hint: they will have <cite>NULL</cite> department codes.)</li>
<li>Get a list of tuples with just the name of everyone whose favorite color is orange.</li>
<li>Find all employees who work in 'Administration.'</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. All files and materials can be downloaded from the fellowship website.</p>
